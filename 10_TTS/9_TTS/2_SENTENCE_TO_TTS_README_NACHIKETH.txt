This script processes a CSV file (27FEBasr.csv) containing text data and generates audio files by performing text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using a TTS model. Here's the breakdown:

Setup Variables:

csv_file_path: Path to the input CSV file.
op_dir: Output directory where synthesized WAV files will be stored (./27FEB/).
Removes any existing temporary script files and WAV files.
Script Execution:

Reads the CSV file and iterates through its rows.
For each row, it extracts the text data and constructs a TTS command to synthesize speech.
Creates a temporary script file (temp_script.sh) to store the TTS synthesis command for each row.
Each command includes setting text data (export data) and WAV file output paths (export name_of_wav) for synthesis.
Executes the Bash script (temp_script.sh) for each command to perform TTS synthesis.
After each synthesis, the temporary script file is removed.
Script Summary:

The script automates the process of generating TTS synthesis commands from a CSV file and initiates the TTS synthesis using a specified TTS model.
For each row in the CSV, it creates a Bash script command to synthesize speech and executes it to generate audio files based on the provided text data.
The resulting WAV files are stored in the specified output directory (./27FEB/), each named according to the row number in the CSV.
This script allows batch synthesis of speech from text data in a CSV file, utilizing the specified TTS model to generate audio files, providing an automated way to create audio from textual content.
