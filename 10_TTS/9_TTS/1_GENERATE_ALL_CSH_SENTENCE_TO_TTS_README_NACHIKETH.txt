This script processes a CSV file (27FEBasr.csv) containing text data and performs text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using a TTS model. Here's a breakdown:

Setup Variables:

csv_file_name: Name of the input CSV file.
root: Root directory where the CSV file is located.
csv_path: Full path to the CSV file.
OUTPUT_DIR: Directory where synthesized WAV files will be stored.
Script Execution:

Removes any existing temporary script files and WAV files.
Defines a function add_line_to_script to add a line to a specified script.
Reads the CSV file and iterates through its rows.
For each row, it extracts the text data and constructs a TTS command to synthesize speech.
Creates a temporary script file (*-TTS-CMDS.csh) to store TTS synthesis commands.
Each command includes setting text data (export data) and WAV file output paths (export name_of_wav) for synthesis.
After adding all commands to the temporary script, it adds a line to activate the Conda environment (conda activate tts-env) at the beginning of the script.
Script Summary:

The script reads text data from a CSV file and generates commands to perform TTS synthesis using a pre-trained model.
For each row in the CSV, it creates a command to synthesize speech and stores it in a temporary script file along with environment activation for the TTS process.
The temporary script (*-TTS-CMDS.csh) can then be executed to initiate the TTS synthesis based on the provided text data.
This script automates the process of generating TTS synthesis commands from a CSV file, enabling batch synthesis of speech from text data using the specified TTS model and environment settings.
